## 📝 AI Post Creator (Lead Magnet)

### What It Creates:
**Viral, engagement-driving LinkedIn posts** that:
- Stop the scroll in 2 seconds
- Provide actionable value
- Encourage comments and shares
- Drive profile visits and connection requests

### Post Structure:

1. **Hook** (First Line - Critical):
   - Provocative question
   - Surprising statistic
   - Bold statement
   - Micro-story opening

2. **Context** (2-3 lines):
   - Relatable problem/situation
   - Speaks directly to reader
   - Sets up the value

3. **Value** (Main Content):
   - 3-5 actionable tips, OR
   - Compelling story with lesson, OR
   - Thought-provoking perspective
   - Short paragraphs (1-2 lines max)
   - Mobile-friendly formatting

4. **Call to Action**:
   - Engaging question
   - Invitation to discuss
   - Prompt for DMs/connections (for lead gen)

### Example Post Generated:

**Topic**: "How I grew my LinkedIn following from 0 to 10k in 6 months"

**Goal**: Lead Generation

**Output**:
```
Most people get LinkedIn growth completely wrong.

They post daily. They use hashtags. They engage with others.

But their follower count barely moves.

Here's what actually worked for me to go from 0 to 10,000 followers in 6 months:

1. Value > Visibility
   Stop posting motivational quotes. Start sharing frameworks people can steal.

2. Hook in first 5 words
   "I made a mistake..." beats "I'm excited to share..." every single time.

3. Comment on 10 posts BEFORE posting
   Warm up the algorithm. LinkedIn rewards active users.

4. One controversial opinion per week
   "Hot takes" get more engagement than safe content.

5. DM connections within 24 hours
   The real magic happens in conversations, not comments.

The secret? Give away your best stuff for free.

Build in public. Help generously. Ask nothing in return.

The followers (and opportunities) will come.
