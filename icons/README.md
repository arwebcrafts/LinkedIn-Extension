# Extension Icons

Placeholder - Replace these with actual icon files:

- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon32.png (32x32)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

For now, the extension will work without icons, but you should add professional icons before distribution.

You can use tools like:
- Figma
- Canva
- Adobe Illustrator

Icon should feature:
- LinkedIn blue color (#0077B5)
- Simple, recognizable symbol
- Professional appearance
- Clear at all sizes
